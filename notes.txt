* maybe seperate render target into it's own class. (with set RT, clear, etc)
* draw to render target, and have it then render from rt to screen
* maybe make the main render target use the render target class too


get a compute shader running that writes to a texture

use a structured buffer for triangles? (models being ray traced)

i think i'll need a deferred renderer type setup? I'll have an intermediary buffer that has uv and intensity that i will then process with the shader.

i don't think we need a depth buffer since it'll all be path traced, so remove that (eventually)

do i need to do anything to strip unused shader constants or otherwise only fill in those used etc?

allow a way to specify screen w/h and fullscreen. Command line?

show fps / mspf

test x64 and release

TODO's

================================= HIGH LEVEL GOALS =================================

1) path trace diffuse / emissive of a scene with a mesh. (monochromatic?)
2) use the brightness values to determine which tileable crosshatching texture to use (trilinear filtering w/ volume texture)
3) success!
4) maybe multiple scenes and some debug displays and such. (IMGUI? Or rely on renderdoc?)
