after first triangle (or so), get code cleaned up

i don't think we need a depth buffer since it'll all be path traced

i think i'll need a deferred renderer type setup? I'll have an intermediary buffer that has uv and intensity that i will then process with the shader.

show fps / mspf

allow a way to specify screen w/h and fullscreen. Command line?

================================= HIGH LEVEL GOALS =================================

1) path trace diffuse / emissive of a scene with a mesh. (monochromatic?)
2) use the brightness values to determine which tileable crosshatching texture to use (trilinear filtering w/ volume texture)
3) success!
4) maybe multiple scenes and some debug displays and such. (IMGUI? Or rely on renderdoc?)
